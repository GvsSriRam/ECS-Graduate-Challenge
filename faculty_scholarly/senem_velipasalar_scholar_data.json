      "year": 2012,
      "abstract": "(57) ABSTRACT A system and method for monitoring events includes defining alert events based on primitive event types in an environment monitored by monitoring devices. Alert parameters are set for each alert event, and alert events are combined to create a composite alert event based on a plurality of alert events. A plurality of engines is monitored to determine if multiple events comprising the composite alert event have occurred.",

      "year": 2016,
      "abstract": "Our society will face a notable demographic shift in the near future. According to a United Nations report, the ratio of the elderly population (aged 60 years or older) to the overall population increased from 9.2% in 1990 to 11.7% in 2013 and is expected to reach 21.1% by 2050 [1]. According to the same report, 40% of older people live independently in their own homes. This ratio is about 75% in the developed countries. These facts will result in many societal challenges as well as changes in the health-care system, such as an increase in diseases and health-care costs, a shortage of caregivers, and a rise in the number of individuals unable to live independently [2]. Thus, it is imperative to develop ambient intelligence-based assisted living (AL) tools that help elderly people live independently in their homes. The recent developments in sensor technology and decreasing sensor costs have made the deployment of …",

      "abstract": "Robust and reliable detection of falls is crucial especially for elderly activity monitoring systems. In this letter, we present a fall detection system using wearable devices, e.g., smartphones, and tablets, equipped with cameras and accelerometers. Since the portable device is worn by the subject, monitoring is not limited to confined areas, and extends to wherever the subject may travel, as opposed to static sensors installed in certain rooms. Moreover, a camera provides an abundance of information, and the results presented here show that fusing camera and accelerometer data not only increases the detection rate, but also decreases the number of false alarms compared to only accelerometer-based or only camera-based systems. We employ histograms of edge orientations together with the gradient local binary patterns for the camera-based part of fall detection. We compared the performance of the proposed …",

      "title": "A survey on activity detection and classification using wearable sensors",
      "year": 2016,
      "abstract": "Activity detection and classification are very important for autonomous monitoring of humans for applications, including assistive living, rehabilitation, and surveillance. Wearable sensors have found wide-spread use in recent years due to their ever-decreasing cost, ease of deployment and use, and ability to provide continuous monitoring as opposed to sensors installed at fixed locations. Since many smart phones are now equipped with a variety of sensors, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and camera, it has become more feasible to develop activity monitoring algorithms employing one or more of these sensors with increased accessibility. We provide a complete and comprehensive survey on activity classification with wearable sensors, covering a variety of sensing modalities, including accelerometer, gyroscope, pressure sensors, and camera- and depth-based systems. We discuss differences in activity types …",

      "year": 2018,
      "abstract": "Content caching at the edge nodes is a promising technique to reduce the data traffic in next-generation wireless networks. Inspired by the success of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in solving complicated control problems, this work presents a DRL-based framework with Wolpertinger architecture for content caching at the base station. The proposed framework is aimed at maximizing the long-term cache hit rate, and it requires no knowledge of the content popularity distribution. To evaluate the proposed framework, we compare the performance with other caching algorithms, including Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU), and First-In First-Out (FIFO) caching strategies. Meanwhile, since the Wolpertinger architecture can effectively limit the action space size, we also compare the performance with Deep Q-Network to identify the impact of dropping a portion of the actions. Our results show …",

      "abstract": "In recent works, the authors introduced a neural operator: a special type of neural networks that can approximate maps between infinite-dimensional spaces. Using numerical and analytical techniques, we will highlight the peculiarities of the training and evaluation of these operators. In particular, we will show that, for a broad class of neural operators based on integral transforms, a systematic bias is inevitable, owning to aliasing errors. To avoid this bias, we introduce spectral neural operators based on explicit discretization of the domain and the codomain. Although discretization deteriorates the approximation properties, numerical experiments show that the accuracy of spectral neural operators is often superior to the one of neural operators defined on infinite-dimensional Banach spaces.",
